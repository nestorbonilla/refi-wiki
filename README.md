| GWP  | Global Warming Potential  | It indicates the amount of warming a gas causes over a given period, normally 100 years. |
| CO2  | Carbon Dioxide  | The most dominant greenhouse gas that comes from burning fossil fuels, industrial production, and land use. |
| CO2e  | Carbon Dioxide Equivalent  | Metric measure that compares emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their GWP by converting amounts of other gases to the equivalent amount of CO2. When it comes to having a direct impact on climate change, the gases to blame are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the so-called F-gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). To quantify CO2e, you need to multiply greenhouse gas amounts by their GWP. |
